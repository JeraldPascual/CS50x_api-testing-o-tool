# üîç API Testing O' Tool

## Overview:

This API Testing Tool is a modern, browser-based application designed to help developers and learners interactively test, analyze, and understand RESTful APIs. Inspired by tools like Postman but built for simplicity and accessibility, this tool is implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It requires no installation or backend server, making it ideal for quick API exploration, debugging, and learning.

## Features

### 1. **Comprehensive HTTP Request Support**
- **Methods:** Supports all major HTTP methods including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, allowing you to test a wide range of API endpoints.
- **Custom API URLs:** Enter any API endpoint you wish to test, from public APIs to your own backend services.

### 2. **Flexible Request Configuration**
- **Custom Headers:** Add any HTTP headers in JSON format, such as `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, or custom headers required by specific APIs.
- **Authorization Token:** Quickly add a bearer token or API key for endpoints that require authentication, streamlining the process for protected APIs.
- **Request Body:** For `POST` and `PUT` requests, input JSON data directly into the request body field, enabling you to create or update resources as needed.

### 3. **Performance Charting**
- **Response Time Chart:** Visualize the response times of your last 10 requests using a dynamic line chart powered by Chart.js. This helps you spot trends, outliers, or performance regressions in real time.
